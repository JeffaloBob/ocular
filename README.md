# ðŸ˜Ž Ocular
0cular, (formerly jeffalo post viewer) is an open source collection of tools that you can use for the scratch forums.

## Tools
- Forum search
- Statistics
- Cool data stuff

## How is such a cool thing even possible?
I'm glad you asked. 
- Data from [DatOneLefty's ScratchDB](https://scratchdb.lefty.one/) (it's not possible without it)
- Styling inspired from [Maximouse](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Maximouse)
- Vercel is used for deployment because of the super neat features (it currently should be acting just like github pages though)
- Vue is used because it's super cool and basically does all the dom manipulation,
- and obviously Scratch!
